# arduino-dino-game-auto
Automate the classic dinosaur game in Chrome using Arduino, LDR, and a servo motor. This project, developed by the 'Open Mind' parascolaire club, allows the game to play autonomously when there's no internet connection. Dive into the world of robotics and game automation with our easy-to-follow Arduino script and hardware setup
# Open Mind Robotic Project

## Description

Welcome to the "Open Mind" parascolaire club's robotic project repository! This project focuses on automating the classic dinosaur game that appears in the Chrome browser when there is no internet connection. The automation is achieved using an Arduino board, a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), a servo motor, a breadboard, and jumper wires.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following hardware components:

- Arduino board
- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- Servo motor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

Make sure you have the necessary software installed:

- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/open-mind-robotic-project.git
   cd open-mind-robotic-project
   
2. **Install Dependencies:**

Open the Arduino IDE and install any necessary libraries for the LDR and servo motor.

3. **Connect the Hardware::**

Refer to the Circuit Diagram section below for guidance on connecting the components.

4. **Circuit Diagram:**

Include a clear and concise diagram of the circuit. You can use tools like Fritzing to create professional-looking diagrams.

**Usage:**

Open the Arduino IDE.
Load the Arduino script (dinosaur_game_auto.ino) from the project folder.
Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
Upload the script to the Arduino board.
Power up the circuit.
Watch as the Arduino automates the dinosaur game when there is no internet access.
